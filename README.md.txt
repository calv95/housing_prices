# Regression and classification with housing data

## Business Case

You work for a real estate company interested in using data science to determine the best properties to buy and re-sell. Specifically, your company would like to identify the characteristics of residential houses that estimate the sale price and the cost-effectiveness of doing renovations.

This project uses the [Ames housing data recently made available on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
